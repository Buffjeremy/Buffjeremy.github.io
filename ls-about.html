      A cup of coffee takes minutes to make, and you enjoy it for a few minutes more. <br>
      They say of beer, you don't buy it you rent it.<br>
      Meanwhile recording an album takes years of dedication. <br>
      Musicians must learn to play an instument and it takes  massive amounts of cordination between band members <br>
      and lots of creative hard work, as well as money often paid out of pocket, <br>
      for local musicians to put their dreams into a collection of songs to share with the world. <br>
      Most people won't bat an eye at spending five dollars on a good latte or a craft beer,<br>
      but those same music lovers would hesitate to spend the same amount<br>
      on an album from a local band they've never heard of.
      The Local Shuffle solves this problem, <br>
      by adding just pocket change to a purchase your already making <br>
      you can get a window into a local band in the form of an actual song download <br>
      Don't like what you hear? Well now you know.<br>
      Like what you hear? Find them on facebook/twitter, buy a t-shirt or the full album <br>
      and figure out when they are playing and go support the local music scene! <br>
      Without the gamble of wondering if you will like the band.<br>
      It's as simple as saying "I'd like to add the Local Shuffle" <br>
      to any of the always local businesses that sell Local Shuffle stickers <br>
      to add to your cup of coffee or your beer. <br>
      Then take the code on the sticker here to our website enter your code and enjoy.<br>
